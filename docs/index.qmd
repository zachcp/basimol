# Basilisp

 Basilisp](https://basilisp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a hosted list on python in the spirit of clojure. This is waht it looks like

```{clojure}
( + 1 1)
```


This is what imports look like.

```{clojure}
(import [os.path :as path])
(python/abs -1)
(path/exists "test.txt") 
```


We can use libraries found on the system's path.

```{clojure}
(import [os.path :as path])
(python/abs -1)
(path/exists "test.txt") 
```


```{clojure}
;; (require '[basimol.core :as bc])
;; (bc/get-view)
```


```{clojure}
(import sys)
sys/path
```
